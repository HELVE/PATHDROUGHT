Wall Installation Idea

4 walls, black screens, mothnode and then Rhizoma Narrative on all walls. people gather inside and watch. Once the installation starts it becomes interactive. There is a line that starts from one corner (one of the screens) and starts to go around and then overlaps. Audience can influence the swirling line by waving their hands. They can also add new points, lines of flight - by touching the screen. A new line starts where they touch the screens.
